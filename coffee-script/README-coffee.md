# Kata - Graph Traversal

This is an example project with some starter code for the graph traversal kata. The source is in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), but compiles to very readable JavaScript which can be just as easily used as is.

To compile the JavaScript (to the 'lib' folder):
```bash
make build
```

To run the tests simply open the file 'index.html' in your browser.
