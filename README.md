# Code Dojo 18 - Graph Traversal kata
This is some boilerplate code for the London Code Dojo's 18th meetup on Feb 18, 2013.

The source of the kata is the graph traversal problem:

## Kata
For any particular [undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29), find the shortest route between any two chosen points.
